## Explanation:

`HTML Code`:

1. The HTML structure defines the title, links to external CSS and JavaScript files, and the basic layout of the page.
2. There's a heading "GitHub Finder" and a form to search for GitHub usernames.
3. The form includes an input field, a search button, and a container for displaying user details.
4. The page also includes a dark mode toggle button.

`CSS Code`:

1. CSS styles are applied for layout, fonts, responsive design, and dark mode.
2. The dark mode changes the background and text colors when toggled.

`JavaScript Code`:

1. JavaScript handles user interactions and dynamically creates user profiles based on the GitHub username entered.
2. When the form is submitted, it fetches user data from the GitHub API and displays the user's profile information.
3. The dark mode toggle button changes the page's theme and icon when clicked.

In summary, this code creates a user-friendly web application for searching GitHub usernames and viewing user profiles. Users can switch between light and dark themes using the toggle button. The application fetches and displays user information from the GitHub API in response to user queries.
